      <h2>Why Kaki?</h2>

      <p>
        Kaki is an AI-powered shopping assistant designed to make online grocery
        shopping simpler, faster, and more convenient. Instead of browsing
        through multiple pages, users can interact with Kaki through natural
        conversations to find products, check availability, and get instant
        assistance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea behind Kaki was to improve the overall shopping experience by
        reducing friction and saving users time. By combining conversational AI
        with an intuitive interface, Kaki helps users quickly locate items,
        discover fresh products, and understand delivery options without
        confusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kaki is built with a user-centric approach, focusing on clarity,
        accessibility, and reliability. The chatbot is continuously improved
        based on user interactions and feedback, ensuring accurate responses and
        a smooth experience across different use cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, Kaki aims to bridge the gap between users and digital
        shopping platforms by acting as a friendly and intelligent assistant
        that supports everyday needs.
